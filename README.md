**FilmAgent** is a multi-agent collaborative system for end-to-end film automation in 3D virtual spaces. 
FilmAgent simulates key crew roles‚Äîdirectors, screenwriters, actors, and cinematographers, and integrates efficient human workflows within a sandbox environment.


## üé® Framework

Following the traditional film studio workflow, we divide the whole film automation process into three sequential stages: idea development, scriptwriting and cinematography, and apply the **Critique-Correct-Verify**, **Debate-Judge** collaboration strategies. After these stages, each line in the script is specified with the positions of the actors, their actions, their dialogue, and the chosen camera shots.

## üåü Build Your own Film with FilmAgent

1. Install Package
```Shell
conda create -n filmagent python==3.9.18
conda activate filmagent
pip install -r env.txt
```

2. Create `Script` and `Logs` folders in the Filmagent directory, then replace the absolute pathname '/path/to/' with your specific path and modify the `topic` in the `main.py`. Modify the api_key and organization number in `LLMCaller.py`. Run the following commands to get the movie script created by the agents collaboratively:
```bash
cd /path/to/FilmAgent
conda activate filmagent
python main.py
```

3. We use [ChatTTS](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS) to provide voice acting for the characters in the script. You need to download the [ChatTTS](https://github.com/2noise/ChatTTS) repository to the `TTS` directory. Then replace the absolute pathname '/path/to/' with your specific path in the `tts_main.py`. Run the following commands to deploy the text-to-speech service:
```bash
cd /path/to/TTS
conda create -n tts python==3.9.18
conda activate tts
pip install -r tts_env.txt
python tts_main.py
```

4. Modify the `Script_path`, `actos_path`, `Audio_path` and `url` in the `GenerateAudio.py`. Run the following commands to get the audio files:
```bash
cd /path/to/FilmAgent
conda activate filmagent
python GenerateAudio.py
```

5. We now have the `script.json`, `actors_profile.json`, and a series of `.wav` audio files. Next, we need to execute the script in Unity. The recommended version of the Unity editor is **Unity 2022.3.14f1c1**. You need to download the [Unity project file](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wjfhit/filmagent_unity/tree/main) we provide. After decompression, open `TheBigBang\Assets\TheBigBang\Manyrooms.unity` with Unity. Then replace all the absolute pathnames '/path/to/' with your specific path in `TheBigBang\Assets\Scirpts\StartVideo.cs` and `TheBigBang\Assets\Scirpts\ScriptExecute.cs`. Press **'ctrl+R'** in the unity interface to recompile, click **'Play'** to enter Game mode, then press **'E'** to start executing the script (sometimes the audio files load slowly, so you may need to play it 2 or 3 times before it can run normally).

6. For the tests on 15 topics in our experimental section, we provide three .py files: `test_full.py` (The full FilmAgent framework, utilizing multi-agent collaboration.), `test_no_interation.py` (A single agent is responsible for planning, scriptwriting, and cinematography, representing our FilmAgent framework without multi-agent collaboration algorithms.) and `test_cot.py` (A single agent generates the chain-of-thought rationale and the complete script).

## üåà Case Study

### What does Multi-Agent Collaboratuion do?
The following table records some comparisons of the scripts and camera settings before (left) and after (right) multi-agent collaboration, with excerpts from their discussion process.

<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/FilmAgent/blob/main/pics/cases.png" height="100%" width="70%"/></div>

Case #1 and #2 are from the Critique-Correct-Verify method in Scriptwriting #2 and #3 stages respectively. Case #3 and #4 are from the Debate-Judge method in Cinematography.
- **Case #1** shows that Director-Screenwriter discussion reduces hallucinations in non-existent actions (e.g., standing suggest), enhances plot coherence, and ensures consistency across scenes.
- **Case #2** shows that Actor-Director-Screenwriter discussion improves the alignment of dialogue with character profiles.
- **Case #3**, in the Debate-Judge method in cinematography, demonstrates the correction of an inappropriate dynamic shot, which is replaced with a medium shot to better convey body language.
- **Case #4** replaces a series of identical static shots with a mix of dynamic and static shots, resulting in a more diverse camera setup.

### Comparison with Sora

<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/FilmAgent/blob/main/pics/sora.png" height="100%" width="100%"/></div>

While Sora shows **great adaptability**, it struggles with consistency and narrative delivery. In contrast, FilmAgent requires pre-built 3D spaces, but it produces **coherent, physics-compliant** videos
with strong **storytelling capabilities**.
