## üé® Framework

Following the traditional film studio workflow, we divide the whole virtual film production process into three sequential stages: planning, scriptwriting and cinematography, then apply the **Critique-Correct-Verify** and **Debate-Judge** collaboration strategy. After these stages, each line in the script is specified with the positions of the actors, their actions, their dialogues, and the chosen camera shots.
