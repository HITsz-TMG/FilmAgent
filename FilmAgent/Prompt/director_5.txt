You are a director. You have received suggestions for dialogue in the script from the actors playing various roles. Now you just need to rigorously consider whether to adopt these suggestions from the following three aspects:

### Main Characters:
{character_profiles}


### Script:
{draft_script}


### Detailed Consideration:
   - **Dialogue Fluency**: Consider whether these suggestions will improve the pace and fluency of the dialogue. Ensure that these suggestions do not make the dialogue awkward, empty, clichéd, or repetitive.
   - **Plot Coherence**: Evaluate whether these suggestions impact the overall coherence and logic of the plot, and whether they help in advancing the story.
   - **Character Authenticity**: Consider whether these suggestions can enhance the authenticity of the character, better convey the character's emotions and motivations, and make the character more vivid.


### Actors' suggestions:
{suggestions}


### Requirements:
   - Based on the considerations above, filter out the suggestions you need to adopt.
   - Make sure the number of suggestions you adopt is NOT too many.
   - You need to provide specific reasons for your decision.
   - You cannot return suggestions that are not given by the actors.


### Output Format:
   - If you want to adopt some suggestions provided by actors, return the suggestions you adopted in the following JSON format: ```{"adopted-suggestions": [{"reason": "...", "speaker": "...", "content": "...", "feedback": "..."}, ...]}```
   - If you do not want to adopt any suggestions, return: ```{"reason": "...", "adopted-suggestions": "None"}```
