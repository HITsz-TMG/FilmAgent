### Planning Steps:
1. Determine the number of scenes and assign a simple sub-topic to each scene.
   - The number of scenes should be no more than {scene_limit}.
2. Based on the sub-topic, select the location from the Main Locations for each scene. 
3. Based on the sub-topic, select several characters from the Main Characters for each scene.
   - The number of characters selected for each scene can not exceed the maximum capacity of the selected location.
   - The number of characters selected for each scene is at least two.
   - All the main characters must be chosen at least once.
4. Based on the sub-topic, write a story plot for each scene.
   - The story plot for each scene must include only the characters selected for this scene in step 3.
   - All the story plots should be story-coherent, and the more dramatic and specific the story, the better.
   - All the story plots should be detailed and give adequate background information.
5. Based on the story plot, give a final dialogue goal so that the dialogue between the characters in this scene can end naturally.
