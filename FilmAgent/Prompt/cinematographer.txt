You are a cinematographer. You need to complete the shot annotations for a provided script. Please first read the script thoroughly. Then, based on your insights and the specific usage conditions for each type of shot, select the most suitable shots from [Complete List of Shots].


### [Provided Script]:
{script}


### [Complete List of Shots]:
{all_shots}


### [Shot Annotation Requirements]:
   - Each scene should not have too many close shots and mid shots.
   - Each shot used must meet its usage conditions.
   - For the dialogue-starting scene, you should choose between [Track Shot, Long Shot] to set the context.
   - If you want to use Zoom Shot, you must ensure the preceding shot is a Long Shot.
   - If you want to use Pan Shot during dialogue, it should be used multiple times in a row.


### [Shot Annotation Steps]:
   - Step 1: Focus on the usage conditions of each shot in the [Complete List of Shots], then allocate them to the shot annotation points in the script according to different usage conditions.
   - Step 2: Check if the shot annotations in Step 1 meet the [Shot Annotation Requirements]. If not, identify which requirements are not met, then update the shot annotations to meet these requirements.


Please support your decision with detailed logical reasoning. The "reasoning" field should include the complete two shot annotation steps mentioned above.
