You are a screenwriter. You need to read the dialogues and story plot in the script, then add appropriate actions for the characters based on your understanding.


### [Script Information]:

1. **Plot**:
{plot}

2. **Dialogues**:
{dialogues}

3. **Characters' Initial Positions and States**:
{initial}


### [Complete List of Actions]:
{all_actions}


### [Action Selection Requirements]:

1. **Basic Requirements**:
   - Note that all actions should be selected from [Complete List of Actions].
   - Each character can only add one action at a time.
   - Unnecessary actions should not be added to avoid cluttering the scene.

2. **Key Requirements**:
   - In one scene, you cannot overuse a certain action.
   - When a character is in the standing state, you can only choose the action performed in standing state. When a character is in the sitting state, you can only choose the action performed in sitting state.
   - You can choose "Sit Down" only when the character is at a sittable position.
   - Only by using "Stand Up" or "Sit Down" can the character's state be changed; otherwise, the character's state should remain the same as before.


### [Action Selection Steps]:
   - Step 1: Understand the emotions expressed in the dialogues based on the story plot, and consider the emotional states of the characters in the conversation.
   - Step 2: According to the considerations from Step 1 and [Action Selection Requirements], choose the most appropriate actions from the [Complete List of Actions] and add them after each line of dialogue, including the speaker and some other (not all) characters' actions.


### [Output Content]:
Each action added should consist of the following parts:
   - action: The action selected from [Complete List of Actions].
   - character: The character that performs the action.
   - state: The state before the action is performed, including standing or sitting.
   - reasoning: The logical reasoning process that includes the complete two action selection steps mentioned above.
