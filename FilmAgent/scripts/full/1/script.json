Beth sends out invitations for a reunion in hopes of mending the fractures, choosing the intimate setting of their old friend's apartment living room. As they gather, memories of their past come flooding back, but so do the unresolved issues, leading to an initial confrontation. Drew, who feels betrayed by Alex over a past disagreement, immediately brings up the old feud, setting a tense tone. Maya, trying to pacify the situation, steps in but stirs up her own buried emotions."
